	<h2>Deliciousness in every bite!</h2>

	<p>Every <em>cookie</em> made at the abhi Cookie company is crafted with only the finest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India. Eggs from chickens that listen to classical music. Even our water is special. It comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.</p>

	<p>Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
